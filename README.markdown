iOS VAST library
================

This repo contains sample project and reusable classes that implement the
following video advertising features, trying to follow IAB standards as close
as possible:

* Showing inline video ads during main content playback
* Supports pre-roll, mid-roll with absolute time positions, post-roll
* Download and parse basic VAST structure as provided by OpenX Source Ad Server
  Video Ad Plugin
* Play breaks are set up using model classes that try to follow VMAP standard


TODO
----

* More robust and full-featured VAST parser
* Add support for other types of ads and play break positions
* Implement VMAP parser
* Implement NSCopying on model classes
